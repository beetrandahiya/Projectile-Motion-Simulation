# Projectile-Motion-Simulation
Using this very simple simulator, You can visualize Projectile motion very easily.<br>
This is made in Javascript using a really amazing physics engine called <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/">matter.js

# Usage 
Its very simple to use just enter the <b>Angle of Projection</b> i.e. in anti-clockwise from +ve horizontal axis,<br> then enter <b>Velocity of Projection</b>, and press <b>Start</b> to start the simulation.

# Caution
The motion isn't totally ideal, although Air drag and friction due to contact is kept zero.<br><br>

Yea, I know there is a bit of problem with the first bounce, but i'm figuring that out.<br>
So, It will be done soon, and I'll be grateful if someone could help me out.
